# Crop-Recommendation-ML
This project uses a machine learning model to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental factors like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It helps farmers make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and farming efficiency.
